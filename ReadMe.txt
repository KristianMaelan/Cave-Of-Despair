Compulsory 3 - Sara Yohannes, Kristian MÃ¦lan and Joakim Askeland

When you run the project you will see a textured cube and the light source (triangle). 
To get to the different scenes:
Scene 1 = press 1
Scene 2 = press 2

1. 	We have a camera that uses lookAt to point towards the player.

2. 	Textured cube with picture of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.

3-4. 	Sat the player and trophy y-coordinate to be 20+ of what heightmap is, so that it 
	is easier to see.

5. 	Collision works, when the player goes through the "throphies" they will disappear.

6. 	Phong is implemented and is shown by the lightsource in form of a triangle.

7. 	You can swap to constructing the heightmap with normals for each vertex at the 
   	bottom of RenderWindow::RenderWindow.
